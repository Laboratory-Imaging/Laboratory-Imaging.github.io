        <h1>Setting up the SE Server on localhost for testing</h1>

        <p>This is the simplest installation where the server accepts requests only from the current machine.
            Because of this significant limitation we can skip the https and SSL certificate configuration.</p>

        <h2>Access to SE Acquisition machine configuration and data</h2>

        <p>The server needs a configuration file from the Platform folder on the Acquisition machine (will call it SE Platform).
            The folder is located here:</p>

        <pre>C:\ProgramData\Laboratory Imaging\Platform</pre>

        <p>The server reads the folders users acquire to as defined in the settings dialog:</p>

        <img class="screenshot-bigger" src="images/SE_Assay_User_Settings.png" />

        <p>Therefore following must ne ensured:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The SE Platform folder must be shared (and accessible by the server),</li>
            <li>all users data folders must be shared (and accessible by the server) and</li>
            <li>the location SE Platform must be specified to the sever on the command line.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The simplest way is to run the server as Administrator and Share the drive C: (and others if necessary)
            on the SE Acquisition machine.</p>

        <h2>Run the server</h2>

        <p>Suppose the SE Acquisition machine is named SEMACHINE and C: drive has been shared. Executing following command runs the server:</p>
        <pre>SEServer.exe --not-secure --se-platform "\\SEMACHINE\C\ProgramData\Laboratory Imaging\Platform"</pre>

        <p>If everything went well the output looks like this:</p>
        <pre>
Using LDAP server at: your.dns.domain
Users will be authenticated as: &lt;username&gt;@YOURDOMAIN
SE settings will be taken from: \\SEMACHINE\C\ProgramData\Laboratory Imaging\Platform
[2025-02-04 09:18:47 +0100] [31488] [INFO] Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (CTRL + C to quit)
        </pre>

        <p>Open your browser and try to put this <tt>http://127.0.0.1:8000</tt> into the address bar.</p>

        <img class="screenshot-bigger" src="images/SE_Login.png" />

        <p>Insert your Windows account credentials. If successful the folder specified in NIS Elements Assay Settings should be listed:</p>

        <img class="screenshot-bigger" src="images/SE_Loggin_Sucess.png" />

        <h2>Login troubleshooting</h2>

        <p>To authenticate Windows users the server uses your domain LDAP server. By default it looks into <tt>USERDNSDOMAIN</tt>
            system environment variable. It can be overridden by <tt>LDAP_SERVER</tt> environment variable or <tt>--ldap-server</tt>
            command line option.</p>

        <p>The username entered into the dialog is is used together with the domain name <tt>&lt;username&gt;@YOURDOMAIN</tt>.
            The domain name is taken by default from <tt>USERDOMAIN</tt> system environment variable. It can be overridden by
            <tt>SE_USERS_DOMAIN</tt> environment variable or <tt>--se-users-domain</tt> command line option.</p>

        <p>To authenticate Windows users the following code is used:</p>

        <pre>
from ldap3 import Server, Connection, ALL
server = Server(_ldap_server, get_info=ALL)
try:
    conn = Connection(server, f'{username}@{_se_users_domain}', login_form.password, auto_bind=True)
    conn.unbind()
except Exception as e:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid credentials")
        </pre>

        <h1>Accessing SE Server from outside</h1>

        <p>Usually it is not possible (or desirable) to expose the server to the internet due to security reasons.</p>

        <p>To overcome this limitation technologies like VPN emerged. They act as tunnel over HTTPS that connects
            a location outside of the local network and the local network. To the client it appears as if it were inside
            the local network.</p>

        <p>Usually there is a program running on the local network and a program on the client PC outside of the local network that make
            the connection possible.</p>

        <p>It is likely that your institution is already using some VPN. In that case it can be used to access the SE Server.
            Otherwise use <a href="https://twingate.com">Twingate</a> as an example of a "VPN-like" solution. It is user friendly
        and we like the features. It is free for up-to 5 users.</p>

        <h1>Twingate</h1>

        <p>The Twingate solution uses a Connector (a program) to provide access to the Resources (e.g. computers, subnets)
            on your private network.</p>

        <p>The connector should be run on linux - either on physical or virtual machine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Physical machine running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.</li>
            <p>Use SSH or PuTTY to log in to the linux machine.</p>
            <img src="images/Physical_Ubuntu.png"/>
            <li>Virtual machine running Ubuntu 22.04 using Windows Hyper-V Manager</li>
            <p>Use "Hyper-V Quick Create" from the Start menu and select Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/Create_Virtual_Machine.png"/>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/Ubuntu_Virtual_Machine.png"/>
        </ul>

        <p>Check on either system that you can access the relevant resource (The PC running the SEServer).</p>

        <h2>Sing up</h2>

        <p>Click <mark>Try Twingate for Free &gt;</mark> at <a href="https://www.twingate.com">twingate.com</a> and fill following three pages:</p>

            <li>Network name and URL</li>
            <p>The Network Name can be changed later and represents the network with the seserver computer.</p>
            <p>The Network URL is important as the account is identified by the URL.</p>

        <h2>Setup: Twingate Onboarding</h2>

        <h3>Add your first resource</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Select the "Fully Qualified Domain Name" (or "IP Address") that you verified earlier,</li>
            <li>select the "Server (Windows, Linux, etc.)" and</li>
            <li>enter the FQDN or IP Address (e.g. <tt>pc-lim-394.firma.lim.cz</tt> or <tt>192.168.11.116</tt>).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Edit the resource</h2>

        <p>Go to "Network", "Resources" and "Edit" inside the menu on three dots (...)</p>

        <p>There you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rename the resource,</li>
            <li>restrict the ports (to 443 only) or</li>
            <li>add an alias in the form of FQDN (to act as DNS if you used IP address).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Managing access to the resources</h2>

        <p>Go to "Network", "Resources" and "Add Access" inside the menu on three dots (...)</p>

        <p>The resource must be granted access rights. Set it to Everyone. Everyone means just you (see the team) right now.</p>

        <p>You can restrict it later whe you will have more users or groups.</p>

        <h2>Test the SE Server on the phone (Android)</h2>

        <p>To check that the resource is accessible lets try to connect to the seserver using a phone.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the SEServer is running.</li>
            <li>Disconnect from the local WiFi to be sure the phone is not on local network.</li>
            <li>Make sure you set the alias above.</li>
            <li>Download the "Twingate" client app from App Store or Google Play.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After authenticating in the app, the resource is visible.</p>

        <p>Open the browser and navigate to the alias.</p>
